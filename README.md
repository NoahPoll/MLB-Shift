Recovering a Causal Effect from AA Baseball: Restricting the Shift on Batter Outcomes
Introduction
In baseball, the impact of restricting the shift on batters is a topic of significant interest. The Major League Baseball (MLB) defines the shift as “a term used to describe the situational defensive realignment of fielders away from their ‘traditional’ starting points.” In practice, this often involves positioning three or more infielders on the same side of second base (referred to as the “skewed alignment shift”). While some shifts involve moving traditional infielders to the outfield, these instances are relatively rare.

The primary goal of the shift is to position the defense optimally for recording outs by anticipating where the opponent is most likely to hit the ball. Shifts have become increasingly prevalent over the years. For instance, in 2011, shifts occurred in only 1.65% of plate appearances, whereas in 2021, they were employed in 35.87% of plate appearances. Even within Major League Baseball, there is substantial variation in the frequency with which teams shift against opposing batters. For example:

The 2021 Los Angeles Dodgers shifted 58.7% of the time.
The Philadelphia Phillies in the same year shifted only 20.7% of the time.
The San Francisco Giants, ranked 19th, shifted 34.7% of the time.
In 2023, MLB implemented restrictions on the shift in an effort to increase offensive production across the league. This rule change has sparked debates about the effectiveness of the shift. In this study, I estimate that restricting the shift leads to a modest 0.006 percentage point increase in batting average on balls in play (BABIP). The data supporting this analysis comes from the restriction of the shift at the AA level in 2021.

# Recovering a Causal Effect from AA Baseball Restricting the Shift on Batter Outcomes

## Introduction

In baseball, what impact does restricting the shift have on batters? The MLB defines the shift as:

> “A term used to describe the situational defensive realignment of fielders away from their ‘traditional’ starting points.”

In practice, this means positioning three or more infielders on the same side of second base, commonly referred to as the “skewed alignment shift.” Some shifts involve moving a traditional infielder to the outfield, though these instances are rare. The objective of the shift is to place the defense in the most advantageous position to record an out, achieved by moving players to where the opponent is most likely to hit the ball.

Shifts have become a significant topic of discussion among baseball fans, managers, and analysts. The frequency of shifts has increased dramatically over the past 13 years. For instance, in 2011, shifts were employed in 1.65% of plate appearances, while by 2021, this had risen to 35.87%. Even within Major League Baseball (MLB), there is considerable variance in how often teams deploy the shift against opposing batters. 

For example:
- The 2021 Los Angeles Dodgers shifted 58.7% of the time.
- The Philadelphia Phillies in the same year shifted 20.7% of the time.
- The San Francisco Giants shifted 34.7% of the time, ranking 19th.

This discrepancy in shift frequency may be influenced by various confounders. In 2023, the MLB restricted the shift to increase offensive numbers league-wide, raising questions about the shift's effectiveness.

Our analysis estimates that restricting the shift causes a 0.006 percentage point increase in batting average on balls in play (BABIP). This analysis utilizes data generated from the restriction of the shift at the AA level in 2021.

## Background

Shifts have seen an exponential increase over recent years, with teams like the Dodgers and Phillies displaying significant differences in their approach to defensive alignment. This section delves deeper into the history and evolution of shifting in baseball, highlighting its strategic significance and the controversy surrounding its effectiveness.

## Methodology

The analysis focuses on the impact of shift restriction at the AA level, where the rule change in 2021 serves as a natural experiment. The methodology section outlines the data collection process, the statistical models used to estimate the causal effect, and the considerations taken to address potential confounders.

## Findings

Our findings indicate that restricting the shift leads to a marginal increase in BABIP by 0.006 percentage points. This section presents detailed statistical results, including tables and figures that illustrate the shift's impact on various batter outcomes.

## Conclusion

The conclusion summarizes the key insights from the analysis, discusses the implications for MLB's decision to restrict the shift, and proposes areas for future research. It reflects on how the shift has shaped modern baseball strategy and what the findings suggest for the game's future.
